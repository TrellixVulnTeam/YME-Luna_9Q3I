## Inspiration

Malaysia has endured a rough period since the pandemic began in 2020, such as the rising unemployment, increasing confirmed cases of Covid-19, and a failing economy. A greater number of people are unemployed, and families have lost their source of income. Due to the public insensitivity and lack of knowledge of Covid-19, the active cases are now increasing rapidly and as of 9.30a.m. today, even reaching the rank 11 globally in terms of active cases. These events brought awareness to us and inspired us to build an application that can make a positive difference in Malaysia’s society and economy.

### What it does

It is a user-friendly website that allows users to search for employment without going through multiple social media, newspapers or even going outside. It also provides users with the fastest channel to obtain useful and reliable information regarding Covid-19 and lockdowns. Luna aims to support low to medium income families in overcoming the COVID-19 crisis and to educate citizens on how to combat COVID-19.

### How we built it

This web application is built with React JS as the front end, and Node JS as the backend integrating with Dialogflow, the AI chatbot API

### Challenges we ran into

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are able to build a complete web application prototype using React JS and Node JS even there is a team member who is not familiar with the framework

### What we learned

We’ve learned how to train an AI chatbot with phrases to interact with users, and successfully compiled a full stack web application. We also learnt the importance of teamwork as the hackathon only runs for 24 hours, collaboration and good communication are essential for the process to go efficiently and smoothly.

### What's next for

Connecting job posting data from either employer or job hunting API, continue training the Luna bot to make it more sophisticated. Deploy the web application in a web server.
